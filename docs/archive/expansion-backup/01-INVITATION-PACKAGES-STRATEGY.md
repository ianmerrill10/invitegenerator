---

## STRATEGIC VALUE

### Why This Works

| Advantage | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Higher AOV** | Digital invites: $0-15 → Packages: $49-199+ |
| **Affiliate Revenue** | 1-10% Amazon commissions on every item |
| **Differentiation** | No competitor offers AI-designed invites + curated physical bundles |
| **Viral Potential** | Recipients receive memorable packages → word-of-mouth |
| **Upsell Path** | Free users → Premium → Packages (natural progression) |
| **Recurring Revenue** | Event hosts often have multiple events (baby shower → 1st birthday → etc.) |

### Revenue Stack Per Package Sale

```
Example: $99 Wedding Package (10 invitations + items)
├── Printed Invitations: $30 cost → $50 charge = $20 margin
├── Curated Items: $35 Amazon cost → You earn ~$2-4 affiliate
├── Curation/Bundling Fee: Built into package price = $15-25 margin
├── Platform Fee: $10-15
└── TOTAL PROFIT PER PACKAGE: $47-64 (47-65% margin)
```

## PACKAGE TIER SYSTEM

| Tier | Name | Price Range | Items Included | Target Customer |
|------|------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Starter** | Essentials | $29-49 | Invitations + 2-3 items | Budget-conscious |
| **Popular** | Classic | $59-99 | Invitations + 4-6 items | Average host |
| **Premium** | Deluxe | $119-169 | Invitations + 7-10 items | Quality-focused |
| **Luxury** | Ultimate | $199-299 | Invitations + 12-15 items | Premium experience |

---

## DYNAMIC PRICING LOGIC

```
Base Package Price = Sum of all item prices + Invitation Cost + Curation Fee

When item deselected:
  New Price = Base Price - Item Price - (Curation Fee × Item Weight%)
  
Example:
  Base Package: $99 (6 items)
  Curation Fee: $15 (distributed as $2.50 per item)
  User deselects $12 item
  New Price: $99 - $12 - $2.50 = $84.50 (rounded to $85)
```

## FULFILLMENT MODEL OPTIONS

| Model | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|-------|------|------|----------------|
| **Direct Amazon Links** | Zero inventory, no shipping hassle, immediate | Lower margins, can't bundle physically | **Start here** |
| **Print-on-Demand + Amazon** | Custom invites + Amazon items | Two shipments to customer | Phase 2 |
| **Full Fulfillment** | Maximum control, best margins | Inventory risk, shipping complexity | Phase 3+ |

**Recommended Approach:** Start with "Curated Cart" model where you:
1. Customer buys package on your site
2. You redirect them to Amazon with pre-filled cart (affiliate links)
3. You separately fulfill printed invitations via print partner
4. Customer receives two shipments but you have zero inventory

# REGISTRY & GIFT GUIDANCE SYSTEM: Complete Strategy

## Overview

This system creates **bidirectional revenue** - earning when people BUY packages to send AND when recipients PURCHASE gifts through affiliate links. This doubles monetization touchpoints per event.

## STRATEGIC VALUE ANALYSIS

### Revenue Flow Comparison

```
STANDARD PACKAGE (Outbound):
Host buys package → You earn $40-60 margin + affiliate

REGISTRY/GIFT CARDS (Inbound):
Host includes registry → 50 guests see it → 30 buy gifts → You earn affiliate on each

COMBINED POTENTIAL:
1 Wedding with 100 guests:
├── Package Sale: $149 (your margin: ~$50)
├── Registry Views: 100 guests
├── Gift Purchases: ~60 guests buy (~$75 avg gift)
├── Affiliate Revenue: $4,500 × 4% = $180
└── TOTAL PER EVENT: $230+ vs just $50
```

### Why This Works

|--------|--------|
| **Multiplier Effect** | 1 host → 50-500 gift-givers see your links |
| **Higher Intent** | Gift buyers are ready to purchase NOW |
| **Premium Perception** | Printed registry cards feel upscale |

## TikTok Strategy (Your Secret Weapon)

TikTok is where you'll get the most bang for your buck. Wedding/party content goes VIRAL here.

### Content Pillars (Post 3-5x Daily)

**1. Transformation Videos (Highest Viral Potential)**
```
Hook: "POV: You just created wedding invitations in 30 seconds"
- Show blank screen → beautiful invitation appears
- Use trending sounds
- End with CTA: "Link in bio to try free"
```

**2. Pain Point Agitation**
```
Hook: "Things that cost way too much for weddings..."
- Show expensive traditional invitation quotes ($500-2000)
- Reveal: "Or you could use AI and pay $15"
- Shock value drives engagement
```

**3. Tutorial/How-To**
```
Hook: "How I designed my wedding invitations for FREE"
- Quick walkthrough of the tool
- Show beautiful end result
- "Comment 'INVITE' and I'll send you the link"
```

**4. Trend Jacking**
- Jump on trending sounds/formats
- Wedding-ify popular trends
- Use trending hashtags + niche hashtags

**5. Before/After**
```
- Split screen: terrible DIY invitation vs. AI-generated
- "Left or right? Comment below"
- Engagement bait = algorithm boost
```

### TikTok Production with CapCut Pro

1. **Record screen capture** of using InviteGenerator

## Automated TikTok Generation (AWS Approach)

Since you have full AWS access, here's how to semi-automate TikTok creation:

### Option 1: AWS Bedrock + Custom Pipeline

1. **Generate scripts** with Claude/Bedrock
2. **Generate voiceovers** with Amazon Polly
3. **Combine with templates** you create in CapCut
4. **Output:** Ready-to-post videos

3. Add trending sound manually
4. Post with scheduling tool

### Content Generation Prompt for Claude:

```
Generate a TikTok script for InviteGenerator.com. The video should be 15-30 seconds.

Format:
- Hook (first 3 seconds): [attention-grabbing opener]
- Problem (3-5 seconds): [pain point]
- Solution (10-15 seconds): [show the tool]
- CTA (3 seconds): [call to action]

Include suggestions for:
- Text overlays
- When to show screen recording
- Recommended trending sounds
```

## Risk Mitigation

### If Ads Aren't Converting:
1. Check landing page load speed
2. Simplify the sign-up process
3. Add more social proof
4. Test different offers (free trial vs. discount)
5. Retarget harder

### If TikToks Aren't Getting Views:
1. Post at different times
2. Use more trending sounds
3. Make hooks more attention-grabbing
4. Engage with comments immediately
5. Duet/stitch popular wedding content

### If Budget Runs Out Early:
1. Focus 100% on organic TikTok (free)
2. Double down on SEO/blog content
3. Leverage email list
4. Push referral program

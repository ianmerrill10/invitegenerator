## Batch Mode Strategy (Scale Content)

### Creating 20+ Variations at Once

1. **Write 5 base scripts** (from above)
2. **Select 4 different avatars** per script
3. **Run batch mode** → 20 unique videos
4. **Export all to TikTok Ads Manager**
5. **A/B test** to find winners

### Avatar Selection Strategy

| Audience | Avatar Type |
|----------|-------------|
| Brides 25-35 | Young woman, relatable, excited |
| Budget-conscious | Practical, helpful friend |
| Luxury seekers | Sophisticated, confident |
| DIY enthusiasts | Creative, hands-on |
| Last-minute planners | Urgent, efficient |

### Variation Ideas

For each script, create versions with:
- Different avatars (gender, age, ethnicity)
- Different CTAs ("Try Free" vs "Save $500" vs "Link in Bio")
- Different hooks (question vs statement vs shock)
- Different backgrounds (home, office, outdoor)

`;
```

const params = {
  Text: 'Your script here',
  OutputFormat: 'mp3',
  VoiceId: 'Joanna', // Or 'Matthew' for male voice
  Engine: 'neural'
};
```

#### 3. Batch Content Creation

Create a weekly batch:
1. Generate 7 scripts with Claude
2. Create voiceovers with Polly
3. Pre-record screen captures of different templates
